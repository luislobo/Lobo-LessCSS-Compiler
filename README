Lobo LessCSS Compiler

This is an attempt to create a Linux LessCSS Compiler GUI (particularly, Ubuntu).

Current release is barely working, since I have just two hours since I started coding my first lines in Python.

It uses Pyinotify to handle directory watching (get it from https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify)

It uses command line 'lessc' LessCSS compiler. Can be installed using sudo apt-get install libnode-less

This is still work in progress!
